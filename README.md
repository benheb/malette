## TODO:
- [X] es6ify it
- [X] build
- [ ] ~~make it a custom element~~ maybe not - you need to manipulate it programatically after the map is instantiated anyway
- [ ] ~~use templates~~ (can only really use html templates with html imports which firefox has said they will not support)
- [ ] ~~package css into it~~ (i think we would need html imports for this too)
- [ ] break it into several files/modules? [ in progress ]
- [ ] use more es6 features [ in progress ]
- [ ] sourcemaps
- [ ] tests
